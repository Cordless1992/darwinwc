Update Notes for update from V0.5 to V0.6
--------------
1. The MySQL database has been moved

2. Several .py files have been renamed, this is purely because this is what they will be called when the software is released.

3. Some changes to the SQL Syntax within the .py files as errors have occured when the changeover from one database to another happened.

4. The project is now officially named Osmium or Os for short.

Planned for V0.7 onwards
--------------
1. Alter code to retrieve database connection details (hostname, login, password, database name) from a text file so it can easily be changed.

2. Security system - This will be designed to control the usage of the software and is not intended to be implemented until the BETA/Release stage of the project development.
